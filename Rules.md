## Common Sense Statute
 
  We're all about having fun here, so our biggest goal is to keep the rules simple and limited. We ask that you don't do things that motivate us to change that. Trying to circumvent the rules through loopholes or arguing over technicalitiess will likely get you returned to a safehub. Please don't be a pain in the ass.


## The Big Four

  We as Epsilon Security Consulting firmly believe in giving people chances to show good behavior. We strive to provide people second chances in spite of past actions in the SLMC. However, sometimes the egregiousness of certain actions goes beyond even our ability to brush them aside. The following are cases that will result in a permanent ban from ESC's sim and any other ESC associated regions.
  
    • Doxxing - distribution of identifying real-life information about others
    • GPU crashing or other griefing intended to damage real-life hardware
    • Content theft via abuse of permissions failures or copybotting, as well as the distribution of that ill-gotten content
    • Mass-abuse reporting
  
  
## General Conduct

1. Harassment - While some level of competitive shit-talk is acceptable, we do not want to see toxic behavior. 
   - We're all here to have fun, and there is no need to try and make people "tilt". This includes pointless bullying and being a general shithead. 
   - If you're coming to the sim with the intent to piss people off and waste time, you will be sent home.

2. Griefing - Griefing can be defined as producing any object in-world that intentionally causes script time to bog down or puts a strain on sim and/or users' FPS. Crashing the sim falls under this definition as well. 
   - This will automatically result in a 24-hour ban, minimum.

3. Client-Side Assists - Usage of wireframe mode, display hitboxes, disabling of prejump, and avatar flight are prohibited. 
   - If comes to our attention that these tools are being used, you will be asked to disable them. 
   - Failure to comply with this request will result in placement on an auto returner or autokiller until compliance is met. 
   - Further refusal will result in a temporary timeout or ban.

4. Sithacking - Sithacking or using personal teleports to access areas that are otherwise off-limits to the public is not allowed. 
   - The first offense will result in being shot. Subsequent offenses will result in offenders being placed on an autokiller or given a temporary timeout off-sim.

5. Safe Zones - Both spawn locations at the corner of the sim are are safe zones. These are marked clearly by spawn doors or by a line on the ground. 
   - Accidental, isolated instances of breaching the safe zones will be forgiven, but continued or intentional cases of firing into or attempting to enter these zones will result in a warning, then a time out, and further until the point is understood.
   - The same goes for attempts to immediately bum rush spawn on entry to the region. 
   - Attackers who use the safe zone to hide from counter fire while employing indirect weaponry (for example, mortars) forfeit this protection and will be targeted until the behavior ceases. 

7. Demonstrations may be requested.
   - In the event that a particular piece of equipment being used on the sim comes into question, the standing OIC for ESC reserves the right to request a demonstration of the item. 
   - The OIC also reserves the right to request the equipment's removal from combat until a later date if it needs more observation by individuals who are more familiar with it. See Rule 7.


8. What the OIC/Administration says goes, period.
   - If there is a legitimate rule dispute mid-combat, it can and will wait until after combat to discuss the circumstances. 
   - Refusal to follow the instruction of the OIC/Administration will result in temporary removal from the region, and depending on how annoying you are or how often you have done this in the past, bans of increasing length.


## Infantry Gear

1. Movement Enhancers
   - Sprints are allowed as long as they have a minimum 5-second cooldown between use.
   - Dodgerolls are permitted. 
   - Boost/Jet/Buttpacks are **PROHIBITED** on the current Volcano/Mars build. 
   - Grapples are **prohibited** on the current Volcano/Mars build.
   - Breaches are **prohibited** on the current Volcano/Mars build.
   - Air strafing is prohibited. 

2. Gun Reload/Cooldown - Guns and energy weapons must use a magazine size reasonable for that particular type of weapon, and they must force a reload or overheat period after that round limit is exceeded that lasts a reasonable period of time. 
   - If it comes to our attention that a weapon isn't reloading at all and it is not a result of simulator performance issues, we reserve the right to request it be replaced.

3. Raycast Weaponry - Hybrid raycast is prohibited on ESC's sim. Raycast must use a reasonable offset for the that particular type of weapon and partial damage must be configured for any offsets.
   - RC offsets exceeding .05 are prohibited unless they have had prior testing and approval.
   - Sensor-based shotguns - Shotguns should be a limited to a reasonable range for their respective types. For example, an automatic shotgun should not extend out to the maximum range of a sensor. 
   - Agentlist weaponry is prohibited. If we discover you are using it and attempting to hide it, you will be warned, and the item added to a blacklist.

4. Explosives and Effects - All explosives and AoE effects are required to perform a raycast check to ensure that targets hit by it are not behind a wall or other obstruction.      - If the explosion does not appear to be performing raycast checks, the standing OIC for ESC reserves the right to request the item be checked. 
     - If there is a problem, you will be asked not to use it until you can show that an update has been applied to fix the issue.

5. Seeker Weaponry - Seekers must make use of the newly adopted seeker system developed by Sin and Criss Ixtar to allow for unified flare use. Seekers must also provide a lock-on tone to the target.

6. Persistent Effects - Any persistent effect used can last no longer than 30 seconds and may not replicate itself. This is enforced on a case-by-case basis due to the good old limitations of Second Life and timers. 

7. Riot Shields - Permitted. However, since it apparently needs to be stated clearly, riot shields must not exceed 50 LBA HP and must go phantom or deactivate when firing.
   - IN OTHER WORDS, DONT FIRE WHEN SHIELD IS UP, RETARDS.

8. Usage of Closed/Defunct Group Gear - Gear from closed groups is permitted on a case-by-case basis. Below is a limited list of specific things that are preapproved:
    - Coercion: Permitted, but exercise common sense. Do not use the dumb dumb av-flying sword.
    - AN: The AN CAR and PDW are permitted for use as they have been extensively tested.


## Vehicles and LBA

1. LBA Variants Rule - For transparency reasons, we currently only allow LBA variants that are hosted on Github or provided through open channels. 
   - If you are utilizing directional armor, there must be a way to report back the ratio modifiers on the armor per each side.
   - Legacy Armor types are not permitted for use at ESC's sim.

2. Armored Ground Vehicles - Ground vehicles must use an LBA version (LBA, LBA Light) that makes sense for its respective type.
   - The faster and and more lightweight the vehicle is, the less armor it should have, and vice versa. 
   - As an example, a Jeep should not have full LBA, let alone more than 25 HP. Tanks and similar vehicles are allowed up to 450 HP and should make sense.

3. Armored Aircraft - Aircraft armor is limited to 200HP for gunship-type craft and 500 HP for fleetships. Armor is prohibited on fighters and basic bombers. 

4. Repairs - LBA Repairs may be completed by manually by users or while in a vehicle, but may not be completed by automated means. 
   - Remote repairs are permitted, up to a maximum range of 10m.


## Deployables

1. Deployable Health Limits - A general limit of 50 HP applies. The following are exceptions to this general rule.
    - Walls are permitted up to a maximum HP of 100. To be more than this, the user must be required to stay nearby until it is fully built. 
    - Interceptors should not exceed 25 HP.
    - Breaches (not permitted at this time) should never exceed 25 HP Inverse LBA.
    - "Engineering kit" generators are permitted to have a maximum of 250 HP.

2. Deployable Limits - Deployables are limited to 2 of each type per person. Interceptors are restricted to 1 deployed per person.

3. Mines - Mines are limited to 5 per person maximum. Mines must be able to be destroyed by LBA or bullet damage and be built with a reasonable activation sensor. 

4. Sit Barricades - Sit Barricades are permitted.
   - Each person gets 1 per life, unless it is moveable.
   - If it is moveable, it must use LBA light and have persistent memory of health that continues from the last health amount available before it was moved. 
   - This can be adjusted on a case-by-case basis.

5. Automated Turrets - Automated turrets are permitted ONLY if they are connected to a destructible energy source. Anti-air turrets that lock on targets must also provide a lock-on tone to the target before firing and while the ordinance is in transit.

6. NPCs - NPCs are permitted on a case-by-case basis. 
   - HP is limited to 25 LBA-L. Ask the defending OIC for approval. The OIC reserves the right to say no if the defending side doesn't feel like putting up with it.


## Banned Equipment

  If an item is on this list, it was put there for a reason. It is likely considered to be super fucking lame or just generally pointless in this day and age. There are also some cases of simply untrustworthy creators that may be added to this list, but they may be removed if they prove themselves to be trustworthy in the future.
  
  - Large scale AoE crowd control (for example, Chaos riot gas, etc)
  - "Stun" effects. If it locks you in place and it isn't a gravity grenade, don't use it.
  - The AN HUD is not permitted due to constant raycast check failures on the frag grenade. 


## Authorized 3rd Party Equipment
  
  Gear permitted for non-ESC Civilian defenders can be found [here](https://epsilonsecurityconsulting.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=641). If something on this list, it's universally permitted for attackers to use as well.
  
  
## Volcano Build Specific Information

  - Stay off the dam. It entirely ruins line of sight on the sim and its mostly for looks. 
  - The same goes for the volcano until the building and underground is completed.
