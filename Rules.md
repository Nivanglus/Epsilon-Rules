## Common Sense Statute
 
  We're all about having fun here, so our biggest goal is to keep the rules simple and limited. We ask that you don't do things that motivate us to change that. Trying to circumvent the rules through loopholes or arguing over technicalitiess will likely get you returned to a safehub. Please don't be a pain in the ass.


## The Big Four

  We believe in giving most people an extra opportunity to show good behavior, when it's warranted, even in spite of previous poor behavior. However, there are some actions that go beyond even our ability to forgive. The following are cases that will result in a permanent ban from ESC's sim and any other ESC associated regions.
  
  - Distribution of identifying real-life information about others, also called "doxxing";
  - GPU crashing or any other griefing intended to damage a user's real-life PC hardware;
  - Creative content theft and distribution without creator permission (ripping textures, copybotting, abusing permissions bugs, etc);
  - Abuse of the Linden Labs AR (abuse report) system; that is, a bad-faith attempt to provoke a direct response from LL with the malicious intent to have someone's account suspended or banned.
    - This, of course, does not apply for cases where individuals have a good-faith reason to involve LL (for example, threats of real-life violence, etc).
  
  
## General Conduct

1. Harassment - While some level of competitive shit-talk is acceptable, being toxic crosses the line. If you aren't enjoying yourself, leave. Don't come here just to piss someone off or waste their time.

2. Griefing - Griefing can be defined as producing any object in-world that intentionally causes script time to bog down or puts a strain on sim and/or users' FPS. Crashing the sim falls under this definition as well. 
   - This will automatically result in a 24-hour ban, minimum.

3. Client-Side Assists - Usage of wireframe mode, display hitboxes, disabling of prejump, and avatar flight are prohibited. 
   - If comes to our attention that these tools are being used, you will be asked to disable them. 
   - Failure to comply with this request will result in placement on an auto returner or autokiller until compliance is met. 
   - Further refusal will result in a temporary timeout or ban.

4. Sithacking - Sithacking or using personal teleporters to access areas that are otherwise off-limits to the public is not allowed. 
   - The first offense will result in being shot. Subsequent offenses will result in offenders being placed on an autokiller or given a temporary timeout off-sim.

5. Safe Zones - The attackers and defenders each have an area to safely spawn into that is clearly marked.
   - Accidental, isolated instances of breaching the safe zones will be forgiven, but continued or intentional cases of firing into or attempting to enter these zones will result in a warning, then a time out, and beyond until the point is understood.
   - If attackers attempt to rush the spawn immediately on entry to take advantage of a slow defense response, they may be equally rushed.
   - Attackers who use the safe zone to hide from counter fire while employing indirect weaponry (for example, mortars) forfeit this protection and will be targeted until the behavior ceases. 

6. Demonstrations of gear may be requested.
   - In the event that a particular piece of equipment being used on the sim comes into question, the standing OIC for ESC reserves the right to request a demonstration of the item. 
   - The OIC further reserves the right to request the equipment's removal from that combat session if they determine the item in question requires further examination by an individual with more expertise.
   - If a bug is discovered, the item should not be used anymore until it is fixed.

7. What the OIC or officer staff says, goes.
   - If there is a legitimate rule dispute mid-combat, it can and will wait until after combat to discuss the circumstances. 
   - Refusal to follow the instructions of the OIC or the request of officer staff will result in removal and/or a ban.

8. Don't Alpha/Beta/RC test gear without asking the OIC 
   - Make your request before combat begins, mid combat requests are likely to be denied.
   - We're willing to be flexible, this depends on your rigidity of this rule on other group owned regions.

## Infantry Gear

1. Movement Enhancers
   - Sprints are allowed as long as they have a minimum 5-second cooldown between use.
   - Dodgerolls are permitted. 
   - Boost/Jet/Buttpacks are permitted, with limits: (to be added)
   - Grapples are permitted, with limits: (to be added)
   - Breaches are permitted, see deployables.
   - Air-strafing/dodgerolling mid-air is prohibited. 

2. Gun Reload/Cooldown - Bullet projectile and energy weapons must have a reasonable round limit, and after that round limit is exceeded, they must force a reload or overheat period that extends for a reasonable amount of time. 

3. Raycast Weaponry - Hybrid raycast is prohibited on ESC's sim. Raycast must use a reasonable offset for that particular type of weapon and partial damage must be configured for any offsets.
   - RC offsets exceeding .05 are prohibited unless they have had prior testing and approval.
   - Agentlist weaponry is prohibited.

4. Explosives and Effects - All explosives and AoE effects are required to perform a raycast check to ensure that targets hit by it are not behind a wall or other obstruction.      
   - If the explosion does not appear to be performing raycast checks, the standing OIC for ESC reserves the right to request the item be checked. 
   - Any persistent effect used can last no longer than 30 seconds and may not replicate itself. 
   - This is enforced on a case-by-case basis due to the good old limitations of Second Life and timers. 

5. Seeker Weaponry - Seekers must make use of the newly adopted seeker system developed by Sin and Criss Ixtar to allow for unified flare use. Seekers must also provide a lock-on tone to the target.

6. Riot Shields - Permitted. However, since it apparently needs to be stated clearly, riot shields must not exceed 50 LBA HP and must go phantom or deactivate when firing.
   - IN OTHER WORDS, DON'T FIRE WHEN SHIELD IS UP, RETARDS.

7. Usage of Closed/Defunct Group Gear - Gear from closed groups is permitted on a case-by-case basis. Below is a limited list of specific things that are currently approved:
    - Coercion: Permitted, but exercise common sense. Do not use the dumb dumb av-flying sword.
    - AN: The AN CAR and PDW are permitted for use as they have been extensively tested.


## Vehicles and LBA

1. LBA Variants Rule - For transparency reasons, we currently only allow LBA variants that are hosted on Github or provided through open channels. 
   - If you are utilizing directional armor, there must be a way to report back the ratio modifiers on the armor per each side.
   - Legacy Armor types are not permitted for use at ESC's sim.

2. Armored Ground Vehicles - Tanks and similar vehicles are allowed up to 450 HP and must use an LBA version (LBA, LBA Light) that makes sense for its respective type.
   - Faster, lightweight vehicles should have light armor, and heavily-armored vehicles should move more slowly.
   - As an example, a Jeep should not have full LBA, let alone more than 25 HP. 

3. Armored Aircraft - Aircraft armor is limited to 200HP for gunship-type craft and 500 HP for fleetships. Armor is prohibited on fighters and basic bombers. 

4. Repairs - Remote repairs are permitted, up to a maximum range of 10m and. The repairs must be completed per-tick, over a reasonable time period. 
   - Automated self-repair is not permitted.


## Deployables

1. Deployable Health Limits - A general limit of 50 HP applies. The following are exceptions to this general rule:
    - Walls are permitted up to a maximum HP of 100. To be more than this, the deployer must be required to stay nearby until it is fully built. 
    - Interceptors should not exceed 25 HP.
    - Breaches should never exceed 25 HP Inverse LBA.
    - "Engineering kit" generators are permitted to have a maximum of 250 HP.

2. Deployable Quantity Limits - Deployables are limited to 5 of each type per person. Interceptors are restricted to 1 deployed per person.
   - Exception is walls. No limit.

3. Mines - Mines are limited to 5 per person maximum. Mines must be destructible by LBA or bullet damage and be built with a reasonable activation sensor. 

4. Sit Barricades - Sit barricades are permitted.
   - Each person gets 1 per life, unless it is moveable.
   - If it is moveable, it must use LBA light and have persistent memory of health that continues from the last health amount available before it was moved. 
   - This can be adjusted on a case-by-case basis.

5. Automated Turrets - Automated turrets are permitted ONLY if they are connected to a destructible energy source. Anti-air turrets that lock on targets must also provide a lock-on tone to the target before firing and while the ordinance is in transit.

6. NPCs - NPCs are permitted on a case-by-case basis. 
   - HP is limited to 25 LBA-L. Ask the defending OIC for approval. The OIC reserves the right to say no if the defending side doesn't feel like putting up with it.


## Banned Equipment

  If an item is on this list, it was put there for a reason. It is likely considered to be super fucking lame or just generally pointless in this day and age. There are also some cases of simply untrustworthy creators that may be added to this list, but they may be removed if they prove themselves to be trustworthy in the future.
  
  - Large-scale AoE crowd control (for example, Chaos riot gas, etc)
  - The AN HUD is not permitted due to constant raycast check failures on the frag grenade. 


## Authorized 3rd Party Equipment
  
  Gear permitted for non-ESC Civilian defenders can be found [here](https://epsilonsecurityconsulting.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=641)(public). If something is on this list, it's universally permitted for attackers to use as well.
